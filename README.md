- 👋 Hi, I’m @Saftey3rd
- 👀 I’m interested in changing my career, I've found what I believe to be my "true calling", if you will. I want to become an AI Software Developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, C++ in my free time. Outside of my full time day job.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any subject, with anyone who could be willing or able to share a nugget of guidence, a dash knowledge , or even a hint of wisdom. All of which are welcome.
